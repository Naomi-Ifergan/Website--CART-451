        <h1> Welcome to Cart 351! </h1>
        <p> Hello classmates, teachers and others, welcome to my Cart 351 personal website!
          For those who are new here, Cart 351 is a Networks and Navigation course taught at Concordia University.
          On this website, I will be uploaded my weekly exercises, projects, reflections and presentations. </P>

        <p> Just a little introduction, my name is Naomi Ifergan and I'm a second year student in the Computation Arts program.
          My favorite software is Adobe Photoshop.
          I love using it to make logos, magazine covers, movie posters and so much more!
          By taking this course, I really hope to further my knowledge in web design using JavaScript and other programming languages.
          I'm looking forward to this class and I can't wait to dive right in!
        </p>
