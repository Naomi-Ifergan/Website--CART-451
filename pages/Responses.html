<h4>  <br>Topic: 'Data Collecting' </br>

<br>Both Corbyn and Segaran’s texts examine data collecting and how the algorithm can improve or worsen a business. More specifically, they discuss the inaccuracy of data through machine learning as it often disregards information that seems unimportant. </br>

<br>Segaran’s text focuses on ‘collective intelligence’ and the limits of machine learning such as inaccuracy, overgeneralization and limited data finds. Segaran discusses companies that have improved their business using data collecting like Google, Amazon and Netflix. However, machine learning is very restricted and must be improved in order to get more accurate data in the future with ties Corbyn’s text. </br>

<br>Unlike Segaran, Corbyn puts all her attention on what she calls ‘data feminism’ which includes data from all minority groups rather than only collecting general data from majority groups such as white men. Corbyn explains that often times, information is being disregarded by machines and computers which results in research inaccuracy. This typically happens when people of color are unrecognizable to facial analysis softwares. Corbyn argues that data itself is sexist and racist rather than neutral as it’s supposed to be. Lastly, she states that we need more marginalized people to enter the coding world to help solve this issue. However the problem can only be fixed if both people on the inside and outside work together in order to increase data accuracy. With that being said, research methods needs to be diversified by interviewing different people of color, gender, religion, age and so forth to really get the best results. </br>

<br>Topic: 'Crowdsourcing' </br>

<br>From my understanding, ‘crowdsourcing’ involves the public aiding in the growth of a company through research and problem solving via the internet. Rather than hirng professionals for the job at higher cost, companies look for everyday people to be part of the solutions and offer a fraction price for their services. As seen in “The Rise of Crowdsourcing” by Jeff Howe, ‘crowdsourcing’ has been very successful for most if not all companies. Companies like  iStockphoto, Viacom, InnoCentive amongst many others have increased their revenues by ‘crowdsourcing’.  Nowadays, companies are cutting costs and are more interested in cheap labor which is upsetting to professionals as they now have to compete with amateurs. This also resulted in many professionals being out of jobs due to the unbeatable prices given by amateurs to companies for the same job. </br>

<br>Written in the early 2000s, this article is definitely outdated as technology has advanced tremendously since then and the list of companies crowdsourcing has gotten much bigger over the years. I wanted to look beyond these examples and discuss something more relevant to today. Influencing, for instance, is a form of crowdsourcing in this day in age. Influencing is a marketing tool on social media that allows users with both small and big platforms to promote products from different companies. As an influencer myself, I am very familiar with this line of work and I can say that Influencing is definitely a form of crowdsourcing. Before social media influencers and content creators, companies invested a lot of money on marketing campaigns through advertising posters, magazines, and commercials. As social media became a marketing tool, companies would often reach out to celebrities and pay big bucks for them to even mention their name. </br>

<br>A commun example of influencing as a form of crowdsourcing is by looking at Kylie Jenner. The most searched question on Google is “How much does Kylie Jenner make per Instagram post?” The answer is around $1.2 million for a single Instagram post. Although she has a great influence on her followers, $1.2 million is quite a lot of money for a marketing budget. Therefore, companies began reaching out to micro-influencers like myself to promote their products. While some companies send out free products in exchange for an Instagram post, others pay their influencers for their services. Therefore, for a fraction of their marketing budget, a company can collaborate with over 200 influencers. Influencers with around 4,000 followers typically charge $80 for a single Instagram post which is definitely seen as cheap labor, therefore it’s a win-win for both companies and Influencers.  That said, these companies prefer  working with micro-influencers instead of celebrities or investing in other marketing tools as mentioned above. Especially since micro-influencers have a closer relationship with everyday people, it will increase the company’s revenue rather than only targetting celebrities for partnerships. </br>
